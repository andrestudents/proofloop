# Failure Handling & Log Inspection

When a run fails, diagnose before suggesting fixes.

## The evidence pack is the log source

Every run seals an **evidence pack**; all run artifacts — actions, console, network, screenshots, failure records — live inside it. **`run_end.run_dir` is legacy: that directory is not created anymore.** Do not try to read `{run_dir}/run-test/...`.

**Find the pack**: `{session_dir}/evidence/<execution_id>.evidence`; testmd/testrun/named runs also land in `<cwd>/.testmuai/evidence/`. The post-run stderr hint names the exact path.

**Read it directly** — a `.evidence` file is a plain zip:

```bash
unzip -l <pack>                                            # list entries
unzip -p <pack> "tests/*/result.yaml"                      # verdict + per-step outcomes
unzip -p <pack> "tests/*/steps/*/failure.yaml"             # failure records (failed steps only)
unzip -p <pack> "tests/*/logs/0-console.ndjson"            # browser console, run 0
unzip <pack> "tests/*/steps/*/screenshot.png" -d /tmp/ev   # extract screenshots to view
```

Pack layout (per test):

```text
tests/<test-id>/
├── test.md                    # the definition
├── result.yaml                # verdict, steps[] (ordinal, status, kind, duration, action_id)
├── logs/
│   ├── meta.yaml              # declares the files below
│   ├── tui.log                # session narrative
│   ├── <n>-run.log            # runner log per run index n
│   ├── <n>-actions.ndjson     # agent actions per run — the old runs/<n>/ actions log, now in-pack
│   ├── <n>-console.ndjson     # browser console, per-step attributed
│   └── <n>-network.har        # network traffic, per-step attributed
├── steps/<ordinal>-<step-id>/ # screenshot.png, annotated.png, step.json,
│                              #   failure.yaml (failed steps only)
├── auteur/execution.json      # full execution trajectory
└── v16-trajectory/            # per-run planning summaries
```

## Debugging Flow

1. **Parse the `run_end` event** from stdout — `status`, `reason`, `summary`, plus `session_dir`.
2. **Open the pack**: the failed step's `failure.yaml` (error + page state), then that step's slice of `<n>-console.ndjson` / `<n>-network.har` — a 4xx/5xx or JS error usually explains the failure; cite it in plain language.
3. **Look at the failing step's `annotated.png`** — it highlights the element the agent acted on; makes "clicked the wrong thing" / "element missing" obvious. Render it inline.
4. **Check `tui.log`** (in the pack's `logs/`, or `{session_dir}/tui.log`) for session-level issues (Chrome launch, auth, upload).

Offer the user the visual route too: `kane-cli evidence serve <pack>` opens it in the hosted viewer. If a pack won't open, `kane-cli evidence validate <pack>` tells you whether it's truncated/unsealed.

**Debug escape hatch:** `KANE_TESTRUN_MEMBER_DEBUG=1` surfaces per-member output in `testrun` (stderr, `[member]` prefix).

## Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| 🔄 Agent repeats same action | Stuck in a loop / page didn't change | Rephrase objective, add explicit wait or assertion |
| 🎯 Agent clicks wrong element | Ambiguous UI, multiple similar elements | Be more specific: "click the **blue** 'Submit' button in the **checkout form**" |
| 👁️ Agent says done but didn't finish | Objective too vague | Add explicit assertions: "assert the confirmation page shows order number" |
| 💀 Exit code 2, no steps | Auth, TMS credential exchange, or Chrome failure | Check `kane-cli whoami`, verify Chrome is available |
| ❓ Exit code 2 with "did you mean …" | Bare-objective shortcut — agent ran `kane-cli "<objective>"` without the `run` subcommand | Re-invoke as `kane-cli run "<objective>" --agent` (same rule for `testmd run` / `generate`) |
| 📤 Upload silently fails after configuring a project/folder by hand | Saved ID is invalid (typo, deleted, no access) | No action needed — the next run detects the 4xx and auto-defaults a working project/folder. To rebind manually: `kane-cli config project` (TTY picker) or `kane-cli projects list` → `kane-cli config project <id>` (see `references/test-manager.md`) |
| ⏱️ Exit code 3 | Timeout or cancelled | Increase `--timeout` or `--max-steps`, or split into smaller objectives |
| 🚫 "CDP endpoint not reachable" | Chrome not running | Let kane-cli manage Chrome (remove `--cdp-endpoint`) |

## Filing a bug report

If the failure looks like a **kane-cli bug** (not auth, timeout, or a vague objective), offer to file a report:

> This looks like it might be a bug in kane-cli. Want me to file a report?

File at: **https://github.com/LambdaTest/kane-cli/issues**. Gather the details automatically — don't ask the user to dig through log files.

**Do NOT suggest bug reports for:** auth issues, low timeouts, vague objectives, or website errors (500s, CAPTCHAs).
