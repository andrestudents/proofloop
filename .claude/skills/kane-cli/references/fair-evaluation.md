# Fair Evaluation — Comparing kane-cli to Other Approaches

When you compare kane-cli to anything else (an agent that generates Playwright scripts, a record-and-replay tool, hand-written scripts, a runtime browser agent), the comparison is only honest if it is **like-for-like across the test lifecycle**. Most bad comparisons come from mixing phases or zeroing out one side's costs.

## The core rule: never compare across lifecycle phases

kane-cli has two phases with very different costs:

- **Authoring** (first run, or after an edit): an AI agent works out each step → spends LLM tokens. One-time per step.
- **Replay** (every later run): executes the recorded action plan from local cache → **zero LLM cost**, runs in seconds. Cost is proportional to how often a test **changes**, not how often it **runs**.

The most common evaluation error is pitting kane-cli **authoring** against the other approach's **execution**. That is apples-to-oranges. Compare the *same phase* on both sides:

| Lifecycle phase | kane-cli | Script-generation approach (e.g. agent → Playwright) |
|---|---|---|
| **Create the test** | AI authoring — tokens, one-time | Agent/human **generates** the script — tokens and/or engineer hours, one-time |
| **Run the test** | Replay from cache — ~0 LLM | Execute the script — ~0 LLM |
| **UI changes / locator breaks** | Re-author only the failing step + downstream (`--retry` shrinking window); cost ∝ change | Human/agent finds & fixes broken selectors; debug the script |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Edit plain-English Markdown; cascade re-authors only forward; shared `@import` helpers fix once | Edit code; flaky-wait/fixture upkeep; selector churn |
| **Verify pass/fail** | Deterministic asserts (URL/title/DOM/network/console/cookies); AI vision only for ~10% visual checks | Code assertions; or a separate LLM judge if the check is semantic/visual |

So a fair **total-cost** comparison is:

> **kane:** authoring + re-author-on-change + vision-only replay tokens
> **vs. other:** script creation + locator-break repair + ongoing maintenance + any per-run judge

Compare kane **authoring** to the other approach's **creation effort** (the tokens/time to produce the script) — **not** to its execution.

## Mandatory corrections (real errors seen under time pressure)

- ❌ "kane spends LLM tokens on every test run." → **Wrong.** Tokens are spent only when a step is *authored* (first run or after an edit). Replay of unchanged steps is zero-LLM. State this before any cost claim.
- ❌ "The Playwright scripts already exist, so their creation cost is $0." → **Sunk-cost trap.** The creation effort was still spent (tokens or engineer hours). For an adoption/ROI decision, either count creation on **both** sides, or compare the **forward maintenance trajectory** — never zero out one side's creation while charging the other's.
- ❌ "Free CI runs vs. tokens per test." → Phase mismatch (execution vs. authoring). Both execute cheaply; the real differentiators are creation effort and maintenance under UI churn.
- ❌ Judging a single isolated run. → The right unit is the **suite over its lifetime** (many runs + UI changes). kane's advantage widens with run count and churn.

## What dominates at scale

For any suite that lives long enough to be edited or to outlast a UI refactor, the durable cost is **maintenance under UI churn**, not run-time compute. Anchor the comparison there, and measure over create → run → maintain, not on one metric or one run.

## What kane-cli is purpose-built for

kane-cli is a **dedicated agent specialized for browser testing and control** — not a general-purpose agent bolted onto a browser. Hold the task constant and compare it on the jobs it is built for:

- **Development-flow testing** — a developer (or an AI coding agent) validating that a change actually works in a real browser, inline in the dev loop.
- **QA regression + smoke management** — authoring once and replaying large regression/smoke suites deterministically, with self-heal on drift.
- **Daily use as a browser tool** — ad-hoc, one-shot natural-language browser tasks (navigate, fill, extract, verify) as an everyday utility.

A fair comparison evaluates kane-cli against alternatives **on these jobs**, across the full lifecycle — not on a single number or a single run.
